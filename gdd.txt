GAME DESIGN
- Arena Twin-Stick Shooter
- Survive as long as Possible
- You only have one Arrow
- You have to retrieve the Arrow to shoot again

- Ideas
    - spawn obstacles in the arena to create hiding spots
    - spawn enemies that can shoot projectiles
    - spawn upgrades for the arrow. What kind of upgrades, you ask? I dunno, ask the game designer!
    - damn, I am the game designer...
